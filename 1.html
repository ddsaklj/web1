the notion that our fate reflects our merit runs deep in the moral intuitions of western culture. This way of thinking ( natural events happen for a reason) is the origin of merotocratic thinking. This is <strong>not far from <u>the comtemporary view</u> that wealth signifies talent and hard work and that poverty signifies indolence</strong>

<p> focusing only on rising does little to cultivate the social bonds and civic attachements that democracy requires. it is often assumed that the only alternative to equality of opportunity is a oppresive equality of results. but there is another alternative: a broad equality of condition that enables those who do not achieve great wealth or prestigious positions to live lives of decency and dignity</p>
